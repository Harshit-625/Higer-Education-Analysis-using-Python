# ðŸŽ“ Higher Education Analysis using Python

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of higher education trends based on global data. It examines student enrollments, field-wise distributions, and placement status to identify patterns that can help improve academic and employability outcomes.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Identify top countries contributing to global higher education.
- Analyze the most and least popular fields of study.
- Compare placement status across different academic disciplines.
- Explore year-wise student enrollment trends and highlight employability gaps.
---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

This analysis was carried out using the following tools and libraries:

- **Python** â€“ The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas** â€“ For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ For creating insightful data visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ For writing and running code in an interactive and well-documented format.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **UAE, UK, and Germany** are the top contributors in terms of higher education enrollment.
- **Engineering and Social Sciences** stand out as the most popular and employable fields.
- A high percentage of students in fields like **Medicine** and **Arts** are marked as *Not Placed*, indicating a skills-employment gap.
- Enrollment trends show yearly fluctuations but a general positive recovery in recent years.
- The analysis reveals a misalignment between academic focus and market demand in certain disciplines.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

The notebook contains multiple visual insights, such as:

- Top 10 countries by student enrollment
- Field-wise student distribution
- Placement status across academic disciplines
- Fields with highest and lowest placement rates
- Year-wise enrollment trends

These visualizations are created using Seaborn and Matplotlib and are embedded directly within the Jupyter notebook.
